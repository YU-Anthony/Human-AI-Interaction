This work aims to develop a simple chatbot. You can try to use this implementation (provided) and your wits (not provided) to build your own conversational agent that will fulfil the set of features.
* **Intent 1 (Name):** This system could start the input loop by asking the user their name, and allow them to change it with a few alternative ways to do so (e.g., "call me X", "change my name to X", etc.). It could then memorise that name and be able to output it on demand
* **Intent 2 (Small talk):** This system could be able to handle a small amount of small talk (hello, how are you, etc)
* **Intent 3 (Question answering):** This system could be able to detect whether the user is asking a question, and use the provided question/answer dataset to do so.

Here is a simple illustration about how this chat will work:
